NPCs:
Bartenders will serve you drinks that you request. 

Wasteyutes are standard bar-goers. 
- They slowly move around, dance, and drink. They drop their drinks and their wallets upon losing all hp
- Upon taking damage, they drop their drinks/foods/walltet and will run out of the bar.
- Wasteyutes can be annoyed by players. Upon being fully annoyed, they will become Aggressive, or Snitch
- If they turn aggressive, they will actively pursue the player and attack them by throwing stuff or scrapping
- If they decide to snitch, they will search for a Bouncer and report you to them, increasing your Notoriety
- The following Annoys Wasteyutes:
- Bumping into them
- Dealing damage to nearby Wasteyutes
- Casting Spells around them
- Puking/Peeing in their vicinity

Bouncers are boss-like NPCs
- Casting spells or puking near a bouncer immediately increases your notoriety and causes them to pursue you
- Bouncers move very fast when pursuing a player and deal a lot of damage.

Notoriety causes the following:
- Wasteyutes become annoyed faster
- Wasteyutes are more likely to become Aggressive than they are to snitch
- Wasteyutes and Bouncers take less damage from you
- Bartenders serve drinks at a premium
- More bouncers will pursue the player

Fine Damsels are sudden-death tiebreakers:
The following increases your favour with them:
- Being close to them with high Notoriety
- Casting spells while close to them
- Damaging other players close to them
- Providing them with a drink
The following decreases your favour with them:
- Damaging them
- Peeing/Puking near them
- Taking Damage near them
At the end of the sudden death no players/NPCs can move anymore, as the Fine Damsel will smooch the player with the highest Favour, causing them to win the round.
Tiebreaks (equal Favour) are settled by Notoriety, then Distance, then player number.
